üìù Instructions üìù

Hey there! Welcome to the Math Quiz. Here's how to answer:

1. Choose the Number of Questions:
Decide how many questions you want to answer. You can choose a specific number or test 
yourself in infinite mode by pressing enter to answer unlimited questions until you decide stop.

2. Select the Operation:
Choose one of the four basic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), 
multiplication (*), or division (/). You can also choose the random option to answer a mix
of all operations.

3. Choose the Difficulty Level:
You'll be asked to select a difficulty level for your questions by inputting the first 
letter of your chosen difficulty:
- üü© Easy: Numbers from 1 to 10, suitable for beginners.
- üü® Normal: Numbers from 1 to 20, a moderate challenge.
- üü• Hard: Numbers from 1 to 100, for advanced practice.
- üíÄ Diabolic: Numbers from 1 to 1000, for math experts!

4. Answer the Questions:
For each question, you'll be given multiple attempts depending on the difficulty level.
- Easy: 1 attempt
- Normal: 2 attempts
- Hard: 3 attempts
- Extra Hard: 4 attempts

5. Review Your Performance:
After the quiz, you'll see a summary of your performance, including the number of correct 
and incorrect answers, and the points you've earned based on the chosen difficulty.

Point System:
üü© Easy: 1 point
üü® Normal: 2 points
üü• Hard: 3 points
üíÄ Diabolic: 4 points

Type "quit" at any time to exit the quiz. 

Good luck and have fun! üéâ
